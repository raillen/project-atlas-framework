# M12 Team / Advanced Runtime — Governance Evaluation & Status

Status: **DEFERRED BY DESIGN (Per v0.4 Architecture & Phases)**

## Governance & Architecture Assessment

### Scope & Specification
Per `docs/development/phases.md:384-390`:
- **Scope**: Shared runtime, leases, concurrency coordination, optional server.
- **Prerequisites**: Dependent on M11, explicitly gated: *"only after real usage validates need — deferred until proven necessary"*.

### Architectural Justification
1. **Lean Progressive Context & Provider-Neutral Core**:
   Project Atlas prioritizes smallest sufficient context, single-agent deterministic execution, and zero unnecessary daemons or central servers.
2. **Local Repository Autonomy**:
   As documented in `docs/architecture/overview.md` and `docs/runtime/control-plane.md`, Atlas is optimized to run locally within developers' environments and CI/CD pipelines without requiring long-lived daemon processes, centralized leasing servers, or distributed lock managers.
3. **Multi-Agent Coordination via Experience Handoff (M9)**:
   Milestone M9 introduced the zero-transcript `Handoff` protocol, allowing sequential or delegated multi-agent state handoff cleanly via files under `.atlas/experience/` without introducing complex network-distributed locking or server processes.
4. **Conclusion**:
   Per formal repository governance, M12 features remain deferred until real multi-agent team usage in production demonstrates an empirical necessity for a shared daemon or server-mediated concurrency coordination.
