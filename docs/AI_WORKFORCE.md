# Agents, Skills and Recipes

## Taxonomy

- **Agent** — who performs work: role, responsibilities and permissions.
- **Skill** — what capability is available.
- **Recipe** — how a work category proceeds.
- **Goal** — which measurable outcome must be achieved.
- **Context Strategy** — what minimum project knowledge is supplied and how it may expand.
- **Model Policy** — which configured models may perform roles and fallback order.
- **Orchestrator** — what coordinates execution.

## Selection rule

Do not load every skill/agent into every project. Resolve the smallest useful workforce from core + project-type bundles + stack + features + risk requirements + dependencies + project overrides.

The same rule applies inside a task: a selected role receives only the relevant Context Pack/structural slices, not the whole registry/documentation set.

## Roles are model-independent

Roles remain stable even when models/providers change. Model routing can therefore improve from project-local cost/quality data without rewriting methodology.

## Core documentation/context capabilities

v0.2 treats these as general engineering capabilities:

- user/developer/operations documentation;
- documentation site/publishing;
- documentation impact/coverage;
- Lean Progressive Context;
- token/output economy;
- Project Intelligence.

They should be selected or mandated based on project needs rather than copied as model prompts everywhere.

## Delegation

Prefer a clean isolated child context only for a bounded question with a compact expected result. Default maximum delegation depth is one.

Delegated output should be a finding + evidence + confidence or an artifact pointer, not a long narrative.

## Risk-mandated capabilities

Security, performance, accessibility, networking, migrations and other high-risk domains may force capabilities regardless of normal selectors.

## Registry evolution

Generic reusable capabilities belong in the framework registry. One-off project instructions belong in project docs/config. Any new context mechanism must justify token/cost impact and define a stopping condition.
