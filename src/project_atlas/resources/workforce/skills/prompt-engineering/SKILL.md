# Prompt Engineering & Evaluation

## Purpose
Author, evaluate, and version system prompts and few-shot examples.

## Use when
- Active Goal or Task explicitly requires prompt engineering & evaluation operations.
- Operating in mode(s): `design`, `testing`.

## Do not use when
- Task is out of scope or unrelated to prompt engineering & evaluation.
- Bounded token budget or capability policy denies required operations.

## Required context
- Task requirements
- System architecture
- Relevant source files

## Procedure
1. Initialize minimal context for prompt engineering & evaluation.
2. Execute scoped operations adhering to protocol standards.
3. Verify correctness with automated test gates.
4. Record task intelligence and evidence.
5. Garbage-collect transient state.

## Decision rules
- Always prefer smallest sufficient changeset over broad refactoring.
- Preserve existing public contracts and architecture invariants.
- Never weaken locked Goal acceptance criteria.

## Evidence required
- test

## Output contract
- Implementation / verification output
- Evidence record

## Stop conditions
- Task acceptance criteria satisfied with evidence
- Token budget exhausted
- Blocked on external dependency

## Escalation rules
- Escalate to lead architect or human if locked Goal criteria cannot be met.
- Escalate immediately upon discovering unexpected security vulnerabilities or data loss risks.
