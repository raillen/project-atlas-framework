# Clang C/C++ Context Indexing — Technical Reference Guide

## Overview & Purpose
Extract AST symbols and compile commands using Clang libclang.

## Core Architecture Principles
1. **Explicit Domain Boundaries**: Align all operations strictly with modular architectural boundaries.
2. **Deterministic Behavior**: Ensure repeatable, verifiable results with zero hidden side-effects.
3. **Defense in Depth**: Validate inputs against canonical schemas before execution.
4. **Lean Context**: Operate only on the minimum required context without speculative expansions.

## Operational Standards
- **Inputs**: Task requirements, System architecture, Relevant source files
- **Outputs**: Implementation / verification output, Evidence record
- **Required Capabilities**: filesystem.read, filesystem.write, process.spawn
- **Evidence Contract**: test

## Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
- Modifying shared state without cryptographic or process locks.
- Suppressing runtime errors or ignoring validation failures.
- Producing unbounded output that violates LPC token limits.
