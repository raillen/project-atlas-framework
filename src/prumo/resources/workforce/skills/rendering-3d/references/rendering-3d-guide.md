# 3D Rendering Pipeline — Technical Reference Guide

## Overview & Purpose
Implement forward/deferred 3D render pipelines, meshes, and lighting.

## Core Architecture Principles
1. **Explicit Domain Boundaries**: Align all operations strictly with modular architectural boundaries.
2. **Deterministic Behavior**: Ensure repeatable, verifiable results with zero hidden side-effects.
3. **Defense in Depth**: Validate inputs against canonical schemas before execution.
4. **Lean Context**: Operate only on the minimum required context without speculative expansions.

## Operational Standards
- **Inputs**: Engine architecture specification, Target hardware / GPU constraints, Benchmark fixtures
- **Outputs**: Optimized engine subsystem, Deterministic benchmark evidence, Visual test fixtures
- **Required Capabilities**: filesystem.read, filesystem.write, process.spawn
- **Evidence Contract**: test, benchmark

## Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
- Modifying shared state without cryptographic or process locks.
- Suppressing runtime errors or ignoring validation failures.
- Producing unbounded output that violates LPC token limits.
