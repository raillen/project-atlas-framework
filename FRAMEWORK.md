# Framework Contract

## Purpose

Project Atlas is a versioned, Git-native engineering protocol for durable, portable and cost-aware AI-assisted development. Prompts, skills, agents, platform adapters and orchestrator configurations are distributions of the protocol, not the protocol itself.

The framework serves four audiences at once: product users, developers/contributors, operators/maintainers and AI agents. It also treats documentation publishing, project intelligence and LLM context efficiency as first-class engineering concerns.

## Core invariants

- **Git is durable memory.** Stable project truth must survive loss of chat history, provider state and local caches.
- **Canonical before generated.** Human knowledge is maintained primarily in Markdown; machine configuration is maintained in JSON. Generated indexes, summaries, caches, dashboards and adapters never replace canonical sources.
- **Few persistent formats.** New Atlas projects maintain Markdown and JSON. SQLite is permitted only for derived/runtime state and is not canonical. YAML is legacy read compatibility only.
- **Project decisions outrank framework defaults.** An explicit project ADR/RFC is authoritative for that project.
- **Goals define completion.** Roadmaps describe direction; locked Goals define measurable done conditions.
- **Acceptance is protected.** Agents may propose amendments but cannot silently weaken locked criteria.
- **Evidence over assertion.** Builds, tests, benchmarks, screenshots, logs, reviews and recorded gates determine completion.
- **Roles are abstract.** Agents are roles; models are routed to roles by project policy.
- **Least workforce.** Load only the agents, skills and recipes needed for the task.
- **Least context.** Under Lean Progressive Context, begin with the smallest sufficient context and expand only when evidence requires it.
- **Pointer over payload.** Prefer stable document/symbol/test references to repeatedly injecting large bodies of text.
- **Context is ephemeral by default.** Working Context Capsules, generated summaries, retrieval traces and derived indexes are runtime state. Persist only durable knowledge and compact project history.
- **Input and output are budgeted.** Token economy covers prompt/context tokens and generated/intermediate output.
- **No unbounded recursion.** Deep recursive LLM execution is not a core requirement. Single-level isolated delegation is the default maximum unless a project explicitly enables and benchmarks an experiment.
- **Documentation follows the audience.** User, developer, operations and agent documentation are explicit surfaces, not afterthoughts.
- **Documentation site is derived.** A public/internal documentation site may be generated continuously from canonical project docs; the site is never a second source of truth.
- **Project Intelligence is durable and honest.** Costs, token usage, effort, quality and debt distinguish observed measurements from estimates and include confidence.
- **Orchestrators are replaceable.** No orchestration product becomes the source of truth.
- **Model preferences are per-project.** Bootstrap explicitly obtains the preferred model/provider roster.
- **Portability first.** A generic Markdown entrypoint remains sufficient for unknown platforms.

## Authority order

1. Explicit current user/project decision.
2. Accepted project ADR/RFC and locked Goal.
3. Canonical project documentation.
4. `atlas.json` and other project JSON contracts.
5. Project Atlas Framework protocol.
6. Generated platform adapter.
7. Generic model/tool defaults.

## Persistence classes

| Class | Purpose | Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical Knowledge | Architecture, product, user/dev/ops docs, specs, ADRs | Git |
| Project History | Compact Goals, cost/task intelligence, durable evidence pointers | Git |
| Working Context | WCC, retrieval evidence, intermediate findings, generated summaries | Runtime/SQLite; garbage-collected |
